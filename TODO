make device server stuff more explicit. It's a bit abstract and unintuitive how config -> device wrapper. Maybe have a separate class for each device.

figure out some way to always pass conf objects between servers and clients. make immune to server restarts.

conductor advance device, specify trigger on different events: sequencer signal, pmt/camera data recv, manual
